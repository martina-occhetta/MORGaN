# MORGaN: self-supervised multi-relational graph learning for druggable gene discovery

This repository provides the official implementation of **MORGaN**, a *masked autoencoder* designed for **self-supervised learning** on *heterogeneous* **m**ulti-**o**mic **g**ene **n**etworks. MORGaN leverages diverse biological relationships to learn expressive node embeddings and identify potential druggable genes with minimal supervision.

üîç What MORGaN does:

MORGaN predicts druggable genes by integrating multi-omic features and multi-relational biological graphs through a three-stage pipeline:
1. **Graph construction**: Assemble a six-relation gene graph using complementary biological data sources (e.g. PPI, co-expression, pathway co-occurrence).
2. **Self-supervised pretraining**: A masked feature reconstruction task (GraphMAE) trains a relational GCN to learn informative embeddings without labels.
3. **Fine-tuning for prediction**: A downstream MLP classifier uses the learned embeddings to predict druggable genes. Performance is evaluated using AUPR, AUROC, accuracy, and F1.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .MORGaN
source .MORGaN/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.MORGaN\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Structure

The data should be organized as follows:
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/          # Multi-modal gene features
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/            # Druggable gene labels
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ networks/          # Network files (PPI and other networks)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ paper/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ graphs/            # Generated graph files
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edge_ablations/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_ablations/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ppi_datasets/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ predict_druggable_genes/
```

## Running Experiments

The code supports four types of experiments:

### 1. Edge Ablation Experiments
Tests the impact of different network combinations on model performance.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_edge_ablations.sh
./scripts/run_edge_ablations.sh
```

This will run experiments:
- With and without PPI edges
- Using different combinations of networks (coexpression, GO, domain similarity, etc.)
- Including random edge versions for each combination

### 2. Feature Ablation Experiments
Tests the impact of different feature combinations on model performance.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_feature_ablations.sh
./scripts/run_feature_ablations.sh
```

This will run experiments:
- Using individual features (CNA, GE, METH, MF)
- Using different combinations of features
- Including a random features version

### 3. PPI Comparison Experiments
Compares performance across different PPI networks.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_ppi_comparison.sh
./scripts/run_ppi_comparison.sh
```

This will run experiments using different PPI networks:
- CPDB
- IRefIndex_2015
- IRefIndex
- STRINGdb
- PCNet

### 4. Main Druggable Gene Prediction Task
Runs the main prediction task using the best performing configuration.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_druggable_genes.sh
./scripts/run_druggable_genes.sh
```

## Configuration Files

Each experiment type has its own configuration file in the `configs/` directory:
- `edge_ablations.yaml`: Edge ablation experiment settings
- `feature_ablation_config.yaml`: Feature ablation experiment settings
- `ppi_comparison_config.yaml`: PPI comparison experiment settings
- `main_task_config.yaml`: Main prediction task settings

## Output

Results are saved in the following locations:
- Model checkpoints: `checkpoints/`
- Generated graphs: `data/paper/graphs/`
- Logs: `logs/`
- Weights & Biases dashboard (if logging is enabled)

## Monitoring Experiments

If logging is enabled in the configuration files, experiments can be monitored through:
1. Console output showing progress and metrics
2. Weights & Biases dashboard (requires wandb account)
3. Log files in the `logs/` directory

## Notes

- Each experiment runs with 2 different random seeds (0, 1), for 3 iterations, for reproducibility
- The code automatically handles the dynamic number of edge types based on the experiment configuration
- Make sure all required data files are in place before running experiments
- For large experiments, consider using a compute cluster or GPU-enabled machine
